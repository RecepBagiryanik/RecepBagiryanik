### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an developer who is interested in a lot of branches of software development, so i learn new things everyday and that is awesome, i want to learn ai development and improving myself in web development.

I know beginner level c++, c# (i wanna learn python and maybe java!) (really, i know a little)

I know intermediate level php, html and css (i wanna learn javascript and nodejs because they are so interesting and i am interested in them!)

My motto is "you must be a life time learner if you want to know everything!";
